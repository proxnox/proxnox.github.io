## What’s New in GPT-5.2: A Quick Overview

GPT-5.2 represents the most substantial upgrade in OpenAI's language model lineup since the release of GPT-4. After spending weeks testing this new GPT model across various scenarios, I'm genuinely impressed by how much has changed under the hood.

### Smarter, faster, and more reliable

OpenAI has supercharged this latest iteration in ways that immediately stand out during everyday use. The first thing I noticed? The sheer processing speed. GPT-5.2 Thinking variant delivers responses at more than 11 times the speed of human experts. Furthermore, it's substantially more efficient, costing less than 1% compared to hiring specialized professionals for the same tasks.

The model's intelligence has taken a significant leap forward too. In my testing, the improved reasoning capabilities became apparent when handling complex multi-step problems. GPT-5.2 now maintains coherence across extraordinarily long conversations, thanks to its expanded context window of 256,000 tokens – equivalent to about 200 pages of text.

Reliability has also received major attention. Previously, I'd often need to fact-check responses, but GPT-5.2 demonstrates a 30% reduction in hallucinations compared to its predecessor. This means fewer errors and more trustworthy outputs across all types of content generation.

### Key differences from GPT-5.1

What truly sets this version apart from GPT-5.1 are several fundamental improvements:

- **GPT-5.2-Codex** (Specialized coding model): A variant optimized for software engineering and security. It adds “context compaction” to manage huge codebases, excels at large-scale refactors/migrations, and is stronger in cybersecurity analysis. In benchmarks like SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0 it dominates, making it a powerful coding assistant for both everyday dev work and advanced security tasks.

- **More variants**: GPT-5.1 introduced Instant and Thinking modes. GPT-5.2 keeps those and adds Pro – a new top-tier model ID for the highest accuracy. Pro is slower but worth it for tricky problems (e.g. legal or medical info) where mistakes are costly

- **Much larger memory**: GPT-5.1 had a big context window already, but GPT-5.2 pushes it to the extreme (hundreds of thousands of tokens). It even offers a /compact mode to extend memory beyond the usual limit. This means GPT-5.2 can “remember” an entire project’s context in one chat, whereas GPT-5.1 would lose track.

- **Vision & tools**: GPT-5.1 was primarily a text model (though it had some vision). GPT-5.2’s vision module is much stronger, it understands charts and images far better. And its “tool-calling” (using APIs and plugins during a chat) is vastly improved: GPT-5.2 can coordinate tools across multiple steps almost flawlessly, where GPT-5.1 often needed help.




- **Advanced reasoning architecture**: GPT-5.2 employs a completely redesigned reasoning system that allows it to break down complex problems into manageable steps, similar to how human experts approach challenging tasks



- **Enhanced multimodal capabilities**: The model now processes and generates visual content with remarkable accuracy, analyzing images and creating visual outputs that closely match requested specifications



- **Sophisticated tool use**: Unlike GPT-5.1, this version can seamlessly integrate with external tools and APIs without constant prompting or clarification

One particularly notable upgrade is in code generation and debugging. As someone who regularly uses AI for programming assistance, I've seen **GPT-5.2 Thinking achieve an impressive 55.6% score on SWE-Bench Pro** – a benchmark consisting of real-world software engineering challenges. In contrast to earlier versions, it can now handle repository-level code understanding and modification.
