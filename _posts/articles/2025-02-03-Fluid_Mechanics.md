# CHAPTER NINE: MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS

## 9.1 INTRODUCTION
- **Fluids**: Liquids and gases are called fluids because they can flow. This is what makes them different from solids.
- **Importance of Fluids**: Fluids are everywhere! Earth has air (a gas) and water (a liquid). Our bodies are mostly water, and fluids help in many processes in living beings.

### Key Differences Between Solids and Fluids:
- **Shape**: Solids have a fixed shape, but fluids take the shape of their container.
- **Volume**: Solids and liquids have a fixed volume, but gases fill the entire container.
- **Compressibility**: Solids and liquids are hard to compress, but gases are easy to compress.

## 9.2 PRESSURE
- **Pressure**: It’s the force applied over an area. The smaller the area, the greater the pressure.
  - Formula: 
    $$
    P = \frac{F}{A}
    $$
  - Units: Pascal (Pa), where 1 Pa = 1 N/m².

### Pascal’s Law:
- **Pascal’s Law**: Pressure in a fluid is the same at the same height. If you increase pressure at one point, it increases everywhere in the fluid.
  - Formula:
    \[
    P = P_a + \rho gh
    \]
  - Where:
    - \( P_a \) = Atmospheric pressure
    - \( \rho \) = Density of the fluid
    - \( g \) = Acceleration due to gravity
    - \( h \) = Height of the fluid column

### Hydraulic Machines:
- **Hydraulic Lift**: Uses Pascal’s law to lift heavy objects with a small force.
  - Formula:
    \[
    F_2 = \frac{A_2}{A_1} F_1
    \]
  - Where:
    - \( F_1 \) = Force applied on the smaller piston
    - \( F_2 \) = Force on the larger piston
    - \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \) = Areas of the pistons

## 9.3 STREAMLINE FLOW
- **Streamline Flow**: When a fluid flows smoothly without crossing paths.
  - **Equation of Continuity**: For incompressible fluids, the volume flow rate is constant.
    \[
    A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2
    \]
  - Where:
    - \( A \) = Cross-sectional area
    - \( v \) = Velocity of the fluid

## 9.4 BERNOULLI’S PRINCIPLE
- **Bernoulli’s Principle**: In a flowing fluid, the sum of pressure, kinetic energy, and potential energy remains constant.
  - Formula:
    \[
    P + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho gh = \text{constant}
    \]
  - Where:
    - \( P \) = Pressure
    - \( \rho \) = Density
    - \( v \) = Velocity
    - \( g \) = Acceleration due to gravity
    - \( h \) = Height

### Applications:
- **Torricelli’s Law**: Speed of efflux (fluid flowing out) from a hole in a tank.
  - Formula:
    \[
    v = \sqrt{2gh}
    \]
- **Dynamic Lift**: Explains why airplanes fly and spinning balls curve.

## 9.5 VISCOSITY
- **Viscosity**: It’s like internal friction in fluids. Thick fluids like honey have high viscosity, while thin fluids like water have low viscosity.
  - Formula:
    \[
    F = 6 \pi \eta a v
    \]
  - Where:
    - \( F \) = Viscous drag force
    - \( \eta \) = Coefficient of viscosity
    - \( a \) = Radius of the object
    - \( v \) = Velocity

### Stokes’ Law:
- **Stokes’ Law**: Describes the drag force on a sphere moving through a viscous fluid.
  - Formula:
    \[
    F = 6 \pi \eta a v
    \]

## 9.6 SURFACE TENSION
- **Surface Tension**: It’s the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid. It’s why water forms droplets.
  - Formula:
    \[
    S = \frac{F}{2l}
    \]
  - Where:
    - \( S \) = Surface tension
    - \( F \) = Force
    - \( l \) = Length

### Capillary Rise:
- **Capillary Action**: When a liquid rises in a narrow tube due to surface tension.
  - Formula:
    \[
    h = \frac{2S \cos \theta}{\rho g a}
    \]
  - Where:
    - \( h \) = Height of the liquid rise
    - \( S \) = Surface tension
    - \( \theta \) = Contact angle
    - \( \rho \) = Density of the liquid
    - \( g \) = Acceleration due to gravity
    - \( a \) = Radius of the tube
